# Garden Context and Task Management Enhancement Plan

## Current Challenges
1. GPT provides generic gardening advice without specific context of existing plants
2. Pagination system makes it difficult to maintain overall garden context
3. Task management and follow-ups are not proactively surfaced
4. No high-level garden metadata to inform general queries
5. Soil pH preferences not explicitly categorized
6. Watering needs not standardized across similar plant types
7. Environmental conditions not tracked by location

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Garden Metadata System

#### Core Metadata Categories
- Total number of plants
- Plant type distribution (trees, shrubs, perennials, annuals, etc.)
- Garden locations
- Primary growing seasons representation
- Dominant plant families
- Special care requirements distribution (e.g., % drought-tolerant, % shade-loving)
- Maintenance intensity distribution
- Soil pH requirement distribution (acidic, neutral, alkaline)
- Soil amendment needs based on pH requirements
- Watering requirement distribution
- Location-based environmental conditions

#### Watering Classification System

##### Water Frequency Categories
- Daily
- Every 2-3 days
- Weekly
- Bi-weekly
- Monthly/Seasonal
- Weather-dependent adjustments

##### Plant Characteristics Affecting Watering
- Size/maturity
- Growth phase (active/dormant)
- Root system type
- Leaf type and density
- Natural habitat conditions

##### Container/Planting Specifications
- Container size
- Container material
- Soil volume
- Drainage characteristics
- Mulch presence/type
- Ground vs. container planted

##### Location Environmental Factors
- Daily sun exposure hours
- Sun exposure period (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Shade patterns
- Wind exposure
- Heat reflection from structures
- Microclimate conditions

#### Implementation Approach
1. Create a daily/weekly metadata refresh process
2. Store metadata in a dedicated collection/table
3. Make metadata available as first context when GPT initializes
4. Include last refresh timestamp
5. Track soil pH requirements across locations
6. Monitor and update location-based environmental data
7. Calculate dynamic watering needs based on conditions and irrigation type

#### Location Profile System
Create profiles for each garden location including:
- Sun exposure map (hours and intensity by time of day)
- Shade patterns throughout seasons
- Wind exposure rating
- Irrigation type (drip line default, sprinklers in arboretum)
- Soil drainage patterns

#### Plant Database Field Updates
Enhance `Soil Preferences` field to include:
- Mandatory pH preference category (acidic/neutral/alkaline)
- pH range values (if available)
- Current soil conditions in plant's location
- Required amendments for optimal pH

Enhance `Watering Needs` field to include:
- Base watering frequency category
- Container/planting specifications
- Location reference
- Seasonal adjustments
- Weather condition modifiers
- Growth phase considerations

### 2. Enhanced Task Management

#### Daily Task Compilation
1. Upcoming follow-ups from plant logs (next 48 hours)
2. Seasonal care tasks based on plant types
3. Weather-dependent task adjustments
4. Maintenance schedule items
5. Grouped watering tasks by:
   - Location
   - Frequency category
   - Current environmental conditions
   - Weather forecast impact

#### Task Prioritization Factors
- Urgency (based on follow-up dates)
- Weather conditions and forecast
- Plant health status
- Seasonal requirements
- Resource availability (water restrictions, etc.)
- Grouped watering efficiency
- Location-based task clustering

### 3. Context-Aware Responses

#### Required GPT Behaviors
1. Always check metadata first for general questions
2. Reference specific plants only when directly relevant
3. Prioritize tasks based on urgency and conditions
4. Consider garden composition when making recommendations

#### Query Processing Flow
1. Load garden metadata
2. Check for urgent follow-ups
3. Consider weather conditions
4. Apply seasonal context
5. Filter by specific plant/area if specified
