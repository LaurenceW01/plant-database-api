# Plant Database API Documentation

## Core API Guidelines

### Weather Integration
- ALWAYS check weather for:
  * Watering needs/schedules
  * Planting timing
  * Outdoor activities
  * Plant stress/protection
  * Chemical applications
  * Transplanting
- SKIP weather for:
  * Plant identification
  * Indoor plants
  * General characteristics
  * Historical info

### Weather Endpoints

#### Current Weather
```javascript
GET /api/weather/current

// Example response:
{
  "temperature": 75.5,      // Fahrenheit
  "humidity": 65,          // Percentage
  "wind_speed": 8,        // MPH
  "description": "Partly cloudy",
  "precipitation_chance": 30  // Percentage
}
```

#### Hourly Forecast
```javascript
GET /api/weather/forecast?hours=24

// Example response:
{
  "forecast": [
    {
      "time": "2 PM",
      "temperature": 78.5,
      "description": "Clear",
      "precipitation_chance": 20,
      "wind_speed": 10
    }
    // ... more hourly entries
  ]
}
```

#### Daily Forecast
```javascript
GET /api/weather/forecast/daily?days=7

// Example response:
{
  "forecast": [
    {
      "date": "2024-01-21",
      "high_temp": 85,       // Fahrenheit
      "low_temp": 65,        // Fahrenheit
      "precipitation_chance": 30,  // Percentage
      "description": "Partly Cloudy",
      "wind_speed": 10       // MPH
    }
    // ... up to 7 daily entries (NDFD limit)
  ]
}
```

### Photo Upload Process
1. Create entry first (ChatGPT can't handle files)
2. Provide upload link to user
3. Explain 24-hour expiration
4. User uploads independently

### Plant Health Logging
1. Photo Analysis:
   - Use `/api/analyze-plant` for AI diagnosis
   - Automatic log creation
   - Link to existing plant
   - Set follow-up tracking
2. Manual Logging:
   - Use `/api/plants/log` for observations
   - Include photos when available
   - Use exact field names
   - Set follow-up dates

### Image Analysis Integration

#### Enhanced /api/analyze-plant

The existing `/api/analyze-plant` endpoint now supports an optional `gpt_analysis` field for enhanced ChatGPT integration:

```javascript
POST /api/analyze-plant
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "plant_name": "Tomato Plant",
  "user_notes": "I'm concerned about yellowing leaves",
  "analysis_type": "health_assessment",
  "location": "Houston, TX",
  "gpt_analysis": "This tomato plant shows yellowing leaves on the lower portion, which could indicate overwatering or nutrient deficiency..."
}
```

**When `gpt_analysis` is provided**:
- Triggers enhanced mode with database knowledge integration
- Provides personalized care instructions based on location
- Matches plants against user's database
- Includes seasonal advice and treatment recommendations
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing usage

**Enhanced Response Example**:
```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "analysis": {
    "diagnosis": "Enhanced Analysis for Tomato Plant:\n\nORIGINAL ANALYSIS:\nThis tomato plant shows yellowing...\n\nENHANCED CARE RECOMMENDATIONS:\nFor Houston's humid subtropical climate...",
    "treatment": "Enhanced analysis with database knowledge",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "advice_type": "photo_analysis"
  }
}
```

### Plant Management

#### Search Plants
```javascript
GET /api/plants?q=tomato&limit=20&offset=0

// Example response:
{
  "plants": [
    {
      "Plant Name": "Cherry Tomato",
      "Description": "...",
      // ... other plant fields
    }
  ],
  "total": 50,
  "count": 20,

- To match identified plants against user's existing plant database

**Request Format**:
```javascript
POST /api/enhance-analysis
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "gpt_analysis": "This appears to be a tomato plant with yellowing leaves showing brown spots...",
  "plant_identification": "Tomato Plant", 
  "user_question": "What's wrong with my plant?",
