# Plant Database API Migration Plan

## Objective
Migrate and expose the existing plant database CRUD operations as a secure API in a new project (to be deployed on render.com), reusing centralized add/update logic, field specifications, and configurations from the current codebase. **The database model must remain unchanged.**

---

## Phase 1: Project Initialization & Planning

- **Set up a new repository and project structure** for the API server.
- **Document all requirements and constraints:**
  - Database model must not change.
  - Reuse existing add/update logic, field specifications, and configurations.
  - Target deployment: render.com.
  - API must be accessible to ChatGPT for integration.
- **Decide on technology stack** (e.g., Flask/FastAPI for Python, etc.).
- **Set up version control and initial README.**

---

## Phase 2: Codebase Migration & Reuse

- **Copy the following from the current project:**
  - Centralized add/update functions (CRUD logic)
  - Field specifications and validation logic
  - Configuration files relevant to database and field handling
- **Adapt code for modularity:**
  - Refactor as needed to separate database/model logic, CRUD operations, and configuration from any UI or unrelated logic.
- **Set up environment variables/configuration for database connection** (matching the current schema).

---

## Phase 3: API Layer Implementation

- **Design RESTful (or GraphQL) endpoints** for:
  - Add plant
  - Update plant
  - Get plant (by ID or name)
  - List/search plants
- **Wrap existing CRUD logic in API endpoints.**
- **Implement input validation and error handling** using existing field specifications.
- **Ensure all responses are structured (JSON).**
- **Document API endpoints with clear usage examples for both human and AI (ChatGPT) clients.**

---

## Phase 4: Security & Access Control

- **Implement authentication/authorization** (API keys, OAuth, or similar).
- **Add rate limiting and abuse prevention.**
- **Log all write operations (add/update) for auditability.**
- **Test for security vulnerabilities.**
- **Ensure secure API exposure for ChatGPT integration (e.g., HTTPS, CORS settings).**

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Write unit and integration tests** for all API endpoints and core logic.
- **Test with both valid and invalid data.**
- **Verify that the database model is unchanged and all CRUD operations work as before.**
- **Test deployment on render.com (staging environment).**
- **Test API accessibility from external clients (including ChatGPT integration test tools).**

---

## Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment

- **Document all API endpoints, required fields, and example requests/responses.**
- **Write deployment instructions for render.com.**
- **Deploy to production on render.com.**
- **Monitor logs and error reports after launch.**
- **Provide a dedicated section in the documentation for ChatGPT/AI integration, including authentication, endpoint usage, and example payloads.**

---

## Phase 7: ChatGPT Integration & Feedback Loop

- **Expose the API securely to the internet so ChatGPT can access it.**
- **Register and configure the API for use with ChatGPT (e.g., via OpenAI function calling or plugin interface).**
- **Define structured command formats for AI (e.g., JSON for add/update requests).**
- **Test ChatGPT-generated requests against the API, ensuring correct parsing and validation.**
- **Implement feedback/confirmation loop for AI-initiated changes (if desired).**
- **Iterate based on user and AI feedback.**
- **Monitor and log all AI-driven interactions for safety and improvement.**

---

## Notes & Constraints
- **The plant database schema/model must remain unchanged throughout.**
- **All field specifications and validation logic should be reused, not rewritten.**
- **No direct database access from AIâ€”only via the secure API layer.**
- **All changes must be logged and auditable.**
- **API must be documented and accessible for ChatGPT integration.**
