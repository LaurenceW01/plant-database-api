3. Assess health, symptoms, and any issues
4. Provide initial assessment to user (2-3 seconds)

### Step 2: Enhanced Database Analysis
1. Call `/api/enhance-analysis` with your vision analysis:
```javascript
{
  "gpt_analysis": "Your complete image analysis text",
  "plant_identification": "Plant name you identified",
  "user_question": "User's question if any",
  "location": "User's location if provided",
  "analysis_type": "health_assessment"
}
```

2. The API will:
   - Match plant against user's database (fuzzy logic)
   - Provide Houston-specific care instructions
   - Enhance diagnosis with database knowledge
   - Assess urgency level
   - Recommend treatment actions

### Step 3: Present Enhanced Results

### Example Flow:
```
User uploads image â†’ 
"I can see this is a tomato plant with yellowing leaves..." (immediate) â†’
Call enhanceAnalysis API â†’
