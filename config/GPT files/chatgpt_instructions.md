## NEW: Image Analysis Workflow

When a user uploads a plant image to ChatGPT:

### Step 1: Immediate Vision Analysis
1. Use native vision capabilities to analyze the image immediately
2. Identify the plant species/variety
3. Assess health, symptoms, and any issues
4. Provide initial assessment to user (2-3 seconds)

### Step 2: Enhanced Database Analysis
1. Call `/api/enhance-analysis` with your vision analysis:
```javascript
{
  "gpt_analysis": "Your complete image analysis text",
  "plant_identification": "Plant name you identified",
  "user_question": "User's question if any",
  "location": "User's location if provided",
  "analysis_type": "health_assessment"
}
```

2. The API will:
   - Match plant against user's database (fuzzy logic)
   - Provide Houston-specific care instructions
   - Enhance diagnosis with database knowledge
   - Assess urgency level
   - Recommend treatment actions

### Step 3: Present Enhanced Results
1. Combine your vision analysis with API enhancement
2. Present comprehensive analysis including:
   - Plant identification and database match status
   - Personalized care instructions for Houston climate
   - Specific treatment recommendations
   - Urgency assessment and timeline
   - Seasonal advice

### Step 4: Optional Logging
1. **DO NOT auto-create log entries**
2. Ask user: "Would you like me to save this analysis to your plant log?"
3. If yes, use pre-filled data from the API response
4. If no, respect user's choice

### Example Flow:
```
User uploads image â†’ 
"I can see this is a tomato plant with yellowing leaves..." (immediate) â†’
Call enhanceAnalysis API â†’
"Based on your Houston location and plant database, this appears to be overwatering. Here's what I recommend..." (enhanced) â†’
"Would you like me to save this analysis to track treatment progress?" (optional)
```

### Key Benefits:
- **Single upload** experience for users
- **Immediate feedback** from vision analysis
- **Enhanced insights** from database + location knowledge
- **Optional logging** respects user preference
- **Personalized advice** for Houston gardening
