# Plant Database API Documentation

## Core API Guidelines

### Weather Integration
- ALWAYS check weather for:
  * Watering needs/schedules
  * Planting timing
  * Outdoor activities
  * Plant stress/protection
  * Chemical applications
  * Transplanting
- SKIP weather for:
  * Plant identification
  * Indoor plants
  * General characteristics
  * Historical info

### Weather Endpoints

#### Current Weather
```javascript
GET /api/weather/current

// Example response:
{
  "temperature": 75.5,      // Fahrenheit
  "humidity": 65,          // Percentage
  "wind_speed": 8,        // MPH
  "description": "Partly cloudy",
  "precipitation_chance": 30  // Percentage
}
```

#### Hourly Forecast
```javascript
GET /api/weather/forecast?hours=24

// Example response:
{
  "forecast": [
    {
      "time": "2 PM",
      "temperature": 78.5,
      "description": "Clear",
      "precipitation_chance": 20,
      "wind_speed": 10
    }
    // ... more hourly entries
  ]
}
```

#### Daily Forecast
```javascript
GET /api/weather/forecast/daily?days=7

// Example response:
{
  "forecast": [
    {
      "date": "2024-01-21",
      "high_temp": 85,       // Fahrenheit
      "low_temp": 65,        // Fahrenheit
      "precipitation_chance": 30,  // Percentage
      "description": "Partly Cloudy",
      "wind_speed": 10       // MPH
    }
    // ... up to 7 daily entries (NDFD limit)
  ]
}
```

### Photo Upload Process
1. Create entry first (ChatGPT can't handle files)
2. Provide upload link to user
3. Explain 24-hour expiration
4. User uploads independently

### Plant Health Logging
1. Photo Analysis:
   - Use `/api/analyze-plant` for AI diagnosis
   - Automatic log creation
   - Link to existing plant
   - Set follow-up tracking
2. Manual Logging:
   - Use `/api/plants/log` for observations
   - Include photos when available
   - Use exact field names
   - Set follow-up dates

### Image Analysis Integration

#### Enhanced /api/analyze-plant

The existing `/api/analyze-plant` endpoint now supports an optional `gpt_analysis` field for enhanced ChatGPT integration:

```javascript
POST /api/analyze-plant
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "plant_name": "Tomato Plant",
  "user_notes": "I'm concerned about yellowing leaves",
  "analysis_type": "health_assessment",
  "location": "Houston, TX",
  "gpt_analysis": "This tomato plant shows yellowing leaves on the lower portion, which could indicate overwatering or nutrient deficiency..."
}
```

**When `gpt_analysis` is provided**:
- Triggers enhanced mode with database knowledge integration
- Provides personalized care instructions based on location
- Matches plants against user's database
- Includes seasonal advice and treatment recommendations
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing usage

**Enhanced Response Example**:
```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "analysis": {
    "diagnosis": "Enhanced Analysis for Tomato Plant:\n\nORIGINAL ANALYSIS:\nThis tomato plant shows yellowing...\n\nENHANCED CARE RECOMMENDATIONS:\nFor Houston's humid subtropical climate...",
    "treatment": "Enhanced analysis with database knowledge",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "advice_type": "photo_analysis"
  }
}
```

### Plant Management

}
```

### Usage Guidelines for Location-Aware Care

**🎯 Primary Use Cases (High Value)**
1. **Individual Plant Care Queries**: "How should I water my hibiscus?" → Use `/api/plants/{id}/location-context`
2. **Location-Specific Questions**: "What's the best watering time for arboretum right?" → Use `/api/locations/{id}/care-profile`  
3. **Container-Specific Care**: "How do I care for my plastic containers?" → Use `/api/garden/containers/{id}/care-requirements`

**✅ When to Use These Endpoints**
- User asks about specific plant care
- Questions about watering times or frequencies
- Container material considerations needed
- Location-specific advice required
- Microclimate factors are relevant

**🔄 Integration Pattern**
1. Get plant location context for specific care advice
2. Use location care profile for general location guidance
3. Get container requirements for material-specific considerations
4. **Always combine with weather data** for current conditions

**💡 Response Enhancement**
Transform generic advice like:
> "Water regularly, ensuring soil doesn't dry out"

Into precise, location-aware guidance:
> "Your hibiscus in arboretum right (4 hours evening sun) in a medium plastic container: Water very early morning (5:30-7:00 AM) to prevent afternoon heat stress on the plastic container. Check soil daily during hot weather as plastic containers in evening sun locations dry faster." 

---

## Phase 2: Advanced Metadata Aggregation (NEW)

### Enhanced Location Intelligence Endpoints

These endpoints provide **comprehensive location analysis and cross-reference intelligence** for advanced garden management and optimization recommendations.

#### Comprehensive Location Analysis
```javascript
GET /api/garden/location-analysis/{location_id}

// Returns comprehensive location analysis with container context and optimization suggestions
// INCLUDES: Plant names and detailed container information for each plant at the location  
// Use when: Need complete analysis of a location including all containers and recommendations

### Phase 2 Usage Guidelines

**🎯 Primary Use Cases (High Value)**
1. **Complete Location Analysis**: Use `/api/garden/location-analysis/{id}` for comprehensive location insights
2. **Full Plant Context**: Use `/api/plants/{id}/context` for complete environmental analysis
3. **Garden Overview**: Use `/api/garden/metadata/enhanced` for garden-wide insights
4. **Optimization Planning**: Use `/api/garden/care-optimization` for improvement recommendations

**🔄 Integration Pattern for Phase 2**
1. Start with enhanced metadata for garden overview
2. Use location analysis for specific location questions  
3. Use plant context for individual plant optimization
4. Use care optimization for proactive recommendations
5. **Always combine with weather** for current conditions

**💡 Enhanced Response Capabilities**
Transform basic location advice into intelligent recommendations:
> "Based on your arboretum right location analysis: 4 containers with 3 plastic in afternoon sun creates medium care complexity. Primary optimization: upgrade plastic containers to ceramic for better heat management. Watering strategy: early morning (5:30-7:00 AM) every other day. Location utilization: excellent for heat-sensitive plants due to north-facing microclimate."
