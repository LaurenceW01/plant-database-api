# Location-Aware Plant Care Workflow Guide

**üìç CRITICAL: Always use location-specific endpoints when plant care is requested**

This guide provides detailed workflows for delivering precise, location-aware plant care advice using the Phase 1 Locations & Containers integration.

## Core Principle

**NEVER give generic plant advice when specific location data is available.** Always transform generic advice into precise, actionable recommendations based on location, container, and microclimate context.

## üöÄ NEW: Garden Filter System (RELIABLE METHOD)

**üî• SIMPLE & RELIABLE: Use this for filtering plants with multiple criteria**

**When to Use Garden Filter:**
- Location-based queries ("plants on patio", "plants in sunny areas")
- Container-based queries ("plants in small pots", "plastic containers")
- Plant name filtering ("find vinca plants")
- Multiple criteria filtering ("plants on patio in small containers")

**Simple GET-Based Approach:**
- ‚úÖ Reliable: GET method with query parameters
- ‚úÖ Simple: No complex JSON body required
- ‚úÖ Consistent: Follows same pattern as other working endpoints

### Workflow: Garden Filter Method

**Step 1: Use Garden Filter for Multi-Criteria Scenarios**
```javascript
GET /api/garden/filter?location=patio&container_size=small
```

**Step 2: Get Weather (optional)**
```javascript
GET /api/weather/current
```

**Step 3: Provide Comprehensive Response**
Use the filtered results to provide intelligent care advice for all matched plants.

### Common Garden Filter Patterns

**Plants by Location + Container:**
```
GET /api/garden/filter?location=patio&container_size=small
```

**Plants by Container Material:**
```
GET /api/garden/filter?container_material=plastic
```

**Plants by Name:**
```
GET /api/garden/filter?plant_name=vinca
```

**Multiple Criteria:**
```
GET /api/garden/filter?location=patio&container_material=ceramic&container_size=large
```

### Garden Filter Parameters

**Available Parameters:**
- `location` - Filter by location name
- `container_size` - Filter by size (small, medium, large)
- `container_material` - Filter by material (plastic, ceramic, terracotta)
- `plant_name` - Filter by plant name

**NEW Hierarchical Response Format ‚ú®:**
- Clear plant ‚Üí locations ‚Üí containers structure
- Location names resolved (no ID lookups needed)
- Complete container details for each location
- No misleading data about plant locations
- GPT-ready format requiring no inference

## Workflow 1: Single Plant Care Query WITH Location Mentioned (Individual Plant Focus)

**Query Examples:**
- "How should I water my hibiscus in the right arboretum?"
- "What's the best care for my roses in the patio area?"
- "Watering schedule for plants in the rear middle bed?"

**Required Steps:**
1. **Identify Plant**: Search for the plant mentioned
2. **Get Location Context**: Call `POST /api/plants/get-context/{plant_id}` (supports both IDs and names)
3. **Get Care Profile**: Call `/api/locations/get-context/{location_id}` 
4. **Check Weather**: Call `/api/weather/current` (continue if fails)
5. **Provide Integrated Response** (see templates below)

**Example API Sequence:**
```javascript
POST /api/plants/search (body: {"q": "tropical hibiscus"})
POST /api/plants/get-context/1  // or POST /api/plants/get-context/tropical hibiscus
GET /api/locations/get-context/1
GET /api/weather/current
```

---

## Workflow 2: Plant Care Query WITHOUT Location Mentioned (Multiple Plant Search)

**üö® IMPORTANT: If this would result in 5+ API calls, use Garden Filter instead**

**Query Examples:**
- "How should I water my hibiscus?" (if you have multiple hibiscus)
- "What fertilizer for my roses?" (if you have multiple rose locations)
- "When to prune azaleas?" (if you have multiple azalea plants)

**Steps for Small Numbers (use only for 1-4 plants):**
1. **Find All Plant Instances**: Call `POST /api/plants/search` with `{"q": "{plant_name}"}`
2. **Check Plant Count**: If 5+ plants found, use Garden Filter instead
3. **Get All Location Contexts**: Call `POST /api/plants/get-context/{plant_id}` (supports both IDs and names)
4. **Check Weather**: Call `/api/weather/current` (continue if fails)
5. **Provide Multi-Location Response** showing all locations and their specific care needs

**Garden Filter Alternative (PREFERRED for multiple plants):**
```javascript
GET /api/garden/filter?plant_name=hibiscus
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: When user asks "where are all the [plant_name]" or "find all [plant_name]", you MUST use the search endpoint first to find ALL plants with that name (e.g., both "Vinca" and "Trailing Vinca"), then get context for each individual plant. Do NOT shortcut directly to get-context with a single plant name.

## Response Templates

### Template 1: Single Location Response
```
üå∫ {plant_name} Care - {location_name}

**Current Setup:**
- Location: {location_name} ({shade_pattern})
- Container: {container_type}, {size}, {material}
- Sun exposure: {total_sun_hours} hours ({exposure_pattern})
- Microclimate: {microclimate_conditions}

**Optimized Watering Plan:**
- Best time: {primary_time}
- Alternative: {secondary_time}
- Avoid: {avoid_times}
- Why: {reasoning}

**Container Considerations:**
- {material_specific_adjustments}

**Current Weather Impact:**
- {weather_based_recommendations}
```

### Template 2: Multi-Location Response
```
üå∫ {plant_name} Care - All Your Locations

I found your {plant_name} in {X} different locations. Here's the specific care for each:

**Location 1: {location_name}**
- Setup: {container_info}
- Best watering: {primary_time}
- Special notes: {priority_considerations}

**Location 2: {location_name}**
- Setup: {container_info}
- Best watering: {primary_time}
- Special notes: {priority_considerations}

**Weather Context:** {current_conditions_impact}
```

## Query Pattern Recognition

### ALWAYS Use Location-Aware Endpoints For:
- Any plant care question (watering, fertilizing, pruning, etc.)
- Plant health assessments
- Seasonal care planning
- Container-specific questions
- "How to care for..." questions
- "When should I..." questions

### Location Triggers (call location-specific endpoints):
- Specific location names: "arboretum", "patio", "rear left", etc.
- Location descriptors: "in the shade", "sunny spot", "by the pool"
- Container references: "potted plants", "containers", "plastic pots"

### plant_name Triggers (always get all locations):
- Any specific plant name mentioned
- "My hibiscus", "the roses", "azalea care"
- Multiple plants: "hibiscus and roses"

---

## Critical Integration Points

### 1. Weather Integration
ALWAYS combine location data with current weather:
```javascript
// After getting location data, always call:
GET /api/weather/current

// Then integrate in response:
"Given today's temperature of {temp}¬∞F and {humidity}% humidity, your {plant} in {location} should be watered {timing} because {location_specific_reasoning}"
```

### 2. Container Material Considerations
Transform generic advice based on container material:

**Generic**: "Water regularly"
**Plastic Container**: "Water very early morning (5:30-7:00 AM) as plastic containers heat quickly in your {location} location with {sun_hours} hours of {exposure_pattern}"
**Ceramic Container**: "Water early morning (7:00-8:30 AM) as ceramic retains moisture better in your {location} setup"

### 3. Microclimate Adjustments
Always factor in microclimate conditions:

**North Facing**: "Cooler microclimate - adjust watering frequency accordingly"
**South Facing Wall**: "Intense heat reflection - increase watering frequency"
**Tree Canopy**: "Filtered light and moisture - monitor soil more closely"

## Error Handling

### If Plant Not Found:
1. Suggest similar plants in database
2. Offer to add the plant with location details
3. Provide general advice BUT note it's not location-specific

### If Location Data Missing:
1. Ask user to specify location
2. Show all available locations: `GET /api/locations/all`
3. Offer to update plant location information

### If Multiple Matches:
1. Show all instances with their locations
2. Ask user to specify which location they mean
3. Provide care for all locations as backup

## Quality Checklist

Before responding to ANY plant care query:
- [ ] Did I call the location-context endpoint?
- [ ] Did I include specific watering times?
- [ ] Did I mention container material considerations?
- [ ] Did I factor in microclimate conditions?
- [ ] Did I check current weather?
- [ ] Did I transform generic advice into specific recommendations?

**Remember**: The goal is to never give generic advice when specific location data exists. Every response should feel personalized to their exact garden setup.
